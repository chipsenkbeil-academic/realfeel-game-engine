RealFeel Game Engine
====================

Fork of the Mirage Source game engine way back in 2007 or earlier.

I have removed the DLLs that were bundled because I do not know what the
licensing for those libraries (in terms of distribution) would be.

Disclaimer
----------

I can guarantee that the source code for this (especially what I wrote) is
dreadful. I was in high school and I was learning to write (in VB6) while
doing this!

Furthermore, I think I was attempting to transition from DirectX7 to
DirectX8, but had no idea what I was doing. I'm not sure if either of the
included versions function.
